toxscreen
=========

toxscreen is currently just an idea. Things may change. Things
may never get done or started. Who knows.

Primary language: C++
UI Library: Qt5

Project aims:
- Open source, cross-platform Teamviewer-like functionality
  using tox's custom packet sending/handling as a means of
  communication.
- Chat should be implemented using basic tox chat (and should
  be similar in style to Teamviewer's chat?).
- Similarly, file transfers can be implemented via tox's file
  transfer functions.
- Should be secure. Only let others trigger click events, file
  transfers, etc. unless allowed.
